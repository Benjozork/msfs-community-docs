## Custom elements

The avionics heavily make use of HTML Custom Elements.

Known element templates include :

```
 - MapInstrument.js - looks like a wrapper for the A320 MFD ?
 - NetBingMap.js    - wrapper for what seems to be a Bing weather / terrain / airport map rendered by Coherent in C++
 ```
